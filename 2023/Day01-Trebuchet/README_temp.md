## Comments / Notes
It was fun knocking the rust off my coding and git skills. 
For Problem 2, I was programming the way I wanted to, but realized I wanted to look up other ways I could do this using Regex. Sadly that turned out not be the answer b/c of the possibility of overlapping words, such as "twone" should be converted to "21".
