Another year, another AdeventOfCode. 
Excited, and nervous for this one, but coming in overall more confident than last year I think. Even though I know how hard and time consuming the problems can be, I know a little better what I'm getting into. 

# What I hope to gain
- more exerpience using Git
	- last year it was hard to setup and maintain. I loved the Markdown conversions of the problem, but it was annoying to do. That will certainly NOT be a requirement for each Day this time. I will add comments & thoughts on the day's problems though in journal style entries. 
	- I still plan on using my lil'RaspberryPi at the start like I did last time, but the lack of IDE functions really hit me hard. Hoping to look into alternatives so I can code on the go (my iPad). 
- maintaining a healthy work-life-balance with this. 
	- last time I kind of went overboard. had a lot of fun but ultimately burnt out and felt shame that I couldn't finish. (in hindsight, I still feel very proud of what I managed to do last time)y
- automatically convert problems to markdown for GitHub README pages
	- I'd like to try and scrape the website for it's problems and convert those into Markdown through a script, but the issue is that the 2nd problem only shows itself after YOU complete the 1st one, and you need to be logged in for that. Unsure how to handle that OAuth stuff.
