While today wasn't ... too hard, it certainly still took a while to complete. 
Problem 1 was fun. 

When getting to Problem 2, I audibly gasped at the processing it would take to brute force it using the solution to Problem 1. 
But after thinking it through I got it working. Not as clean as I'd like, but it works. Fast too - at 00.000996 seconds!

Found that importing the sample_input really helps with troubleshooting quickly - compare the debugging process to that of the website. Forgot I had started doing that last year too. 
That and, while my Problem 2 CAN perform Problem 1's work, I wanted to keep the previous function for posterity.
