Problem 2 took me longer than I expected b/c I didn't read wording close enough. Once I did, it was an easy tweak to the code. Lessoned learned.
Glad that Advent of Code has two problems. It is good practice in pivoting code that we've already made and to remember to be aware of potential changes that could come down the line, but not to go too hard in preparing for that. Just make your code flexible and well documented enough to change it in future itterations. 
I can already tell that I've gone a little hard on the ```html_to_markdown``` side project for this. Feeling slightly burnt out. While I could endlessly customize and tinker with it, I will do one more update and finish it. Which is to allow updates to the README by retaining the Comment section (but keep it at the bottom)
Need to use a pomodoro timer to keep from burning out. My goal this year is to make it more than last year, which was 16 days.
