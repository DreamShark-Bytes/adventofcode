Glad this problem took way less time than yesterday.
Was a little worried prb2 would take a while to run by brute-forcing it but only took 8 seconds. No super smarts needed.

Did discover better ways to automate the process of testing code. global day variable, and list of lambdas for the different ways to run problem 1 and problem 2. 

After seeing some people on reddit visualize their coding. I'd love to see what I can learn in doing that when I have more time - maybe this weekend.
