# What is Advent Of Code
https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

> Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

# Purpose of this exercise
My initial reason for starting this was for a number of reasons. 
Mainly it was to learn more about:
1. python programming language
2. git and github

I'd also have extra motivation to do this since coworkers and friends were also doing the Calendar this year. 

# Comments about the Experience 
So, this has been really tough and I am appreciating the difficulty. It's really making me push myself and because of that, the code can be a bit messy. Still, I'm trying my best.
Here are some of the things I've been pleasantly surprised that I've been learning along the way, outside the main goals:
1. Better trouble shooting problem solving
2. Confidence in coding. Leading to quicker prototyping and ultimately a solution.
3. Understanding priorities
    - for instance I've been putting way more time into reading and ingesting the input file when I could manually assign variable values instead.
4. Carefully reading and understanding what is written.
    - I'm surprised this was troublesome for me. I'd often find myself running into issues finding a solution to a problem only to realize I hadn't thoroughly read the problem's constraints. 
5. Understanding intentions through provided examples
    - After Day 9, some of the problems' constraints weren't explicitly laid out, but instead demonstrated through examples. I found great success in testing my code by making sure it could perfectly emulate the examples.  
6. at the midway point of the calendar I found myself increasingly worried about the "Part 2" of any problem. Asking questions like "how much would I have to refactor my code for if I did it wrong?" and "how long would that take?" 
7. I enjoyed toying with ideas of how to make a problem's code quicker or more robust for other uses. But hardly had the time to linger on those thoughts. There was always more to do. 

# End Result of the calendar endeavor
During the 25 days, I managed to mostly keep up with the pace of the daily release, but sadly day 16's second problem was proving tough and it was the straw that broke the camel's back and I got burnt out. 
The main takeaway that will help me be prepared for next year's Advent of Code: Have ALL of my Christmas shopping done and plans made before December.

So by the end, I got 31 stars out of 50. I'm still proud of the work I managed to get done, and can feel the benefits from the exercise! I'm excited to try and finish these problems at my leisure.
